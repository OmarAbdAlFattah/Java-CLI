# Java-CLI

This CLI should prompt the user to enter the input through the keyboard. After a sequence of characters is entered followed by a return, the string is parsed and the indicated command (s) executed. The user is then again prompted for another command.

The following commands: clear, cd, ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, cat, more, pwd. should be implemented.
